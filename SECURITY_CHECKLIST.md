## üîÑ Monthly Security Controls

### Regular Audits (Monthly)
- [ ] Review access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Audit user permissions and remove unnecessary access
- [ ] Check for outdated dependencies (`npm audit`, `composer audit`)
- [ ] Review firewall rules and update as needed
- [ ] Verify backup integrity and test restore process
- [ ] Review SSL/TLS certificate expiration dates
- [ ] Check for security patches and apply updates
- [ ] Review error logs for anomalies
- [ ] Verify security headers are still active
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

### Dependency Management (Weekly)
- [ ] Run `npm audit` and fix high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Run `composer audit` and update vulnerable packages
- [ ] Review Dependabot security alerts
- [ ] Update Docker base images to latest secure versions
- [ ] Check for framework security updates (Laravel, React)

### Monitoring & Alerting (Continuous)
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts and alert on anomalies
- [ ] Track API rate limit violations
- [ ] Alert on unusual database access patterns
- [ ] Monitor for new CVEs affecting dependencies
- [ ] Track changes to admin user accounts
- [ ] Monitor file integrity (unexpected file changes)
- [ ] Alert on certificate expiration (30 days notice)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Incident Response Plan

### Immediate Response (< 1 hour)
1. **Identify** the security incident (breach, vulnerability, attack)
2. **Isolate** affected systems or services
3. **Notify** security team and stakeholders
4. **Document** all actions taken

### Short-term Response (< 24 hours)
1. **Assess** the scope and impact of the incident
2. **Contain** the threat (block IPs, disable accounts, patch vulnerabilities)
3. **Preserve** evidence for forensic analysis
4. **Communicate** with affected users (if required by law)

### Recovery (< 7 days)
1. **Remediate** the root cause of the incident
2. **Restore** systems from clean backups if needed
3. **Verify** security controls are working
4. **Test** systems before returning to production

### Post-Incident (< 30 days)
1. **Conduct** post-mortem analysis
2. **Update** security policies and procedures
3. **Train** team on lessons learned
4. **Implement** additional controls to prevent recurrence
5. **Report** to regulatory bodies if required

- API rate limit violations
- Security vulnerabilities discovered and patched
- Time to patch critical vulnerabilities (target: < 24 hours)
- Number of security incidents
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) security incidents
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) to security incidents
- Percentage of dependencies up to date
- Percentage of code covered by security tests

## ‚úÖ Sign-off

**Security Officer**: ____________________  
**Date**: ____________________  
**Production Deployment Approved**: [ ] YES [ ] NO

**Notes**:
- All high and critical security issues must be resolved before production deployment
- Medium issues should have a remediation plan with timeline
- Low issues can be addressed in future sprints
- Security checklist must be reviewed and updated quarterly
