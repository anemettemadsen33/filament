**Issues to Fix:**
- Missing security headers
- Need to enforce HTTPS
- Update vulnerable dependencies

### SEO (Current: 100/100, Target: 100)
Measures search engine optimization.

**Status:** ✅ Excellent (maintain this!)

**Recommendations:**
- Add structured data for properties
- Generate sitemap.xml
- Implement canonical URLs

## 🔧 Implementation Priority

### Week 1: Security & Quick Wins
**High Priority, Low Effort**

```bash
# 1. Fix security headers
# Edit: Rental-Platform-main/backend/app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php
# See Lighthouse-Analysis.md #15

# 2. Update dependencies
cd Renthub
npm audit fix

# 3. Add response caching
# Edit: Rental-Platform-main/backend/app/Http/Middleware/CacheResponse.php
# See Lighthouse-Analysis.md #6
```

**Expected Improvement:** +15-20 performance points

### Week 2-3: Performance Optimization
**High Priority, Medium Effort**

```bash
# 1. Image optimization
# Edit: Rental-Platform-main/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/PropertyImageController.php
# See Lighthouse-Analysis.md #4

# 2. Database optimization
# Create migration for indexes
# See Lighthouse-Analysis.md #8

# 3. Bundle size reduction
cd Renthub
npm run build
# Review dist/stats.html
# See Lighthouse-Analysis.md #1
```

**Expected Improvement:** +25-30 performance points

### Week 4: User Experience
**Medium Priority, Low-Medium Effort**

- Optimize lazy loading strategy (#2)
- Add keyboard navigation (#10)
- Verify ARIA labels (#9)

### Week 5: SEO & Discoverability
**Medium Priority, Low Effort**

- Implement SEO component (#12)
- Create sitemap (#13)
- Add structured data

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Scores After Each Change
```bash
# Run Lighthouse after implementing fixes
lighthouse http://localhost:5173 \
  --output json \
  --output-path ./after-fix

# Compare with baseline
python3 << 'EOF'
import json

with open('reports/lighthouse/sample-baseline-20251023.json') as f:
    baseline = json.load(f)
    
with open('./after-fix.report.json') as f:
    current = json.load(f)

for category in ['performance', 'accessibility', 'best-practices', 'seo']:
    base_score = baseline['categories'][category]['score'] * 100
    curr_score = current['categories'][category]['score'] * 100
    diff = curr_score - base_score
    
    print(f"{category}: {curr_score:.0f} ({diff:+.0f})")
EOF
```

### Set Up Performance Budget
Create `lighthouse-budget.json`:
```json
{
  "resourceCounts": [
    { "resourceType": "script", "budget": 10 },
    { "resourceType": "stylesheet", "budget": 5 },
    { "resourceType": "image", "budget": 30 }
  ],
  "resourceSizes": [
    { "resourceType": "script", "budget": 300 },
    { "resourceType": "stylesheet", "budget": 50 },
    { "resourceType": "image", "budget": 1000 },
    { "resourceType": "total", "budget": 2000 }
  ]
}
```

Run with budget:
```bash
lighthouse http://localhost:5173 \
  --budget-path=lighthouse-budget.json \
  --view
```

2. Test in incognito mode
3. Test on different networks
4. Check server response times

### Reports Not Generated
1. Verify lighthouse CLI is installed
2. Check if servers are running

2. **Prioritize** issues based on business impact
3. **Create tickets** for each optimization task
4. **Assign owners** to implementation tasks
5. **Run baseline audit** on your production site
6. **Start with Phase 1** (Week 1 quick wins)
7. **Monitor progress** weekly using Lighthouse CI
8. **Iterate** based on results
