- competition (low/medium/high)
- cpc (number in USD)
- trend (rising/stable/falling)
- relatedKeywords (array of strings)
```

### Content Analysis Prompt
```
Analyzes title, meta, and content returning:
- seoScore (0-100)
- readabilityScore (0-100)
- suggestions array with:
  - type (critical/warning/info/success)
  - category (8 predefined categories)
  - message (specific actionable text)
  - priority (1-5 scoring)
```

### Content Generation Prompt
```
Creates content based on:
- type (blog_post/product_description/etc)
- topic (user-defined)
- keywords (comma-separated list)
- tone (professional/casual/etc)
- length (short/medium/long with word counts)

Returns plain text content optimized for SEO
```
