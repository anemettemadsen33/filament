}
```

### Message Flow
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system'
  content: string
  timestamp: number
  intent?: Intent
  entities?: Entity[]
  sentiment?: Sentiment
  suggestedProperties?: Property[]
}
```

## 📊 Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Natural Language Search
```
User: "I need a 2 bedroom apartment in Brooklyn under $2500"

AI extracts:
- bedrooms: 2
