### Data Models

#### SMSSettings
```typescript

## Integration Points

### App.tsx Integration
The main application automatically triggers SMS notifications:

```typescript
const handleAddBooking = (booking: Booking) => {
  // ... booking creation logic
  
  // Send email confirmation
  sendBookingConfirmationEmail(booking, property, currentUser)
  
  // Send SMS confirmation to guest
  sendBookingConfirmationSMS(booking, property, currentUser)
  
  // Schedule check-in/check-out reminders
  scheduleCheckInCheckOutReminders(booking, property, currentUser)
  
  // If urgent, notify landlord via SMS
  if (property.landlord) {
    sendNewBookingSMS(booking, property, landlordUser)
  }
}
```

### Maintenance Integration
When integrated with the maintenance system:

```typescript
if (request.priority === 'high' && landlord.phone) {
  await sendUrgentMaintenanceSMS(request, property, landlord)
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Phone Number Management
- Store phone numbers in E.164 format (+country code)
- Validate phone numbers before sending
- Allow users to update their phone numbers easily

### 2. Cost Management
- SMS notifications are only sent for urgent events
- Users can disable notification types they don't need
- Monitor SMS logs to track usage and costs

### 3. Compliance
- Comply with local SMS marketing regulations (TCPA, GDPR, etc.)
- Include opt-out instructions in messages
- Store user consent for SMS communications
- Respect quiet hours (no messages late at night)

### 4. Message Quality
- Keep messages under 160 characters when possible
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include relevant identifiers (booking IDs, property names)
- Always include brand name (RentHub)

### 5. Error Handling
- Log all SMS attempts (success and failure)
- Retry failed messages with exponential backoff
- Alert administrators of consistent failures
- Provide fallback to email if SMS fails

## Testing

### Test Mode Setup
1. Use Twilio test credentials for development
2. Configure test phone numbers in Twilio console
3. Monitor test message logs in dashboard

### Test Scenarios
- ‚úÖ Urgent booking (within 24 hours)
- ‚úÖ Booking confirmation
- ‚úÖ High-priority maintenance request
- ‚úÖ Check-in reminder (24h before)
- ‚úÖ Check-out reminder (24h before)
- ‚úÖ Payment due notification (3 days before)

## Monitoring & Logs

### SMS Activity Log
The SMS Settings Panel includes a log viewer showing:
- **Message Type**: Category of notification
- **Recipient**: Phone number (partially masked)
- **Status**: Sent or Failed
- **Timestamp**: When message was sent
- **Message Content**: Full message text
- **Error Details**: Failure reasons if applicable

### Log Storage
- Logs stored in `spark.kv` under key `sms-logs`
- Limited to 100 most recent messages
- Automatically pruned to save storage

## Security Considerations

### API Credentials
- Store API keys and secrets in KV storage
- Never expose credentials in client-side code
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate credentials periodically

### Phone Number Privacy
- Mask phone numbers in logs (show last 4 digits only)
- Don't share user phone numbers with third parties
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate phone numbers before storage

### User Permissions
- Only property owners can configure SMS settings
- Users control their own notification preferences
- Landlords cannot see tenant phone numbers (unless shared)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Two-way SMS**: Allow recipients to reply to messages
2. **Scheduled Messages**: Pre-schedule notifications
3. **Bulk SMS**: Send messages to multiple recipients
4. **SMS Templates**: Customizable message templates
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Delivery rates, open rates, response times
6. **Multi-language Support**: Localized SMS messages
7. **Smart Timing**: Send messages at optimal times based on timezone
8. **Message Threading**: Group related messages in conversations

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Calendar Integration**: Sync with booking calendars
2. **Payment Gateway**: Payment confirmation via SMS
3. **Review Requests**: SMS review reminders after stay
4. **Emergency Alerts**: Critical property issue notifications
5. **Verification Codes**: SMS-based 2FA for security

## Troubleshooting
