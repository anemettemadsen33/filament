# Sprint Summary - Images & Reviews Implementation

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Progress:** 88% → 95% (Production Ready)

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

Complete the Images & Storage feature (Phase 2) and verify Reviews system (Phase 3), bringing the platform to production-ready state.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Images & Storage - Backend (2.1 & 2.2)

#### Storage Configuration

- ✅ Verified `config/filesystems.php` public disk configuration
- ✅ Updated `.env` to use `FILESYSTEM_DISK=public`
- ✅ Created `storage/app/public/properties/` directory structure
- ✅ Verified `public/storage` symlink exists
- ✅ Installed Intervention Image library (`intervention/image-laravel` 1.5.6)
- ✅ Published Intervention Image config

#### Backend API Implementation

Created `PropertyImageController` with complete CRUD operations:

- ✅ `store()` - Multi-file upload with processing
  - Validates file types (PNG/JPG/WEBP/GIF)
  - Enforces size limit (10MB per file)
  - Caps at 20 images per property
  - Auto-orients images (EXIF rotation)
  - Resizes to max 1600x1200 (85% quality)
  - Organizes by `properties/{id}/{year}/{month}/`
  - Auto-assigns first image as primary if none exists
  - Returns array of created images with URLs

- ✅ `destroy()` - Delete image with cleanup
  - Removes file from storage disk
  - Reassigns primary if deleted image was primary
  - Deletes database record

- ✅ `setPrimary()` - Set primary image
  - Transactional update (unset old, set new)
  - Returns updated image resource

- ✅ `reorder()` - Sort images
  - Accepts ordered array of image IDs
  - Updates `sort_order` field
  - Returns ordered collection

**API Routes (all under auth:sanctum)**

```text
POST   /api/properties/{property}/images
DELETE /api/properties/{property}/images/{image}
PATCH  /api/properties/{property}/images/{image}/primary
PATCH  /api/properties/{property}/images/reorder
```

#### Authorization

- Uses existing `PropertyPolicy::update()` for all image operations
- Ensures only owner or admin can manage property images

### 2. Images & Storage - Frontend (2.3)

#### Service Layer Alignment

Updated `propertyImage.service.ts`:

- ✅ Upload response mapping: `{ data: [...] }` → `{ images: [...] }`
- ✅ Reorder payload: `image_ids` → `order` (matches backend expectation)
- ✅ TypeScript types aligned with backend resources

#### Image Manager Component

Updated `PropertyImageManager.tsx`:

- ✅ Accept GIF format in file picker
- ✅ Updated help text: "Max 20 images per property. PNG/JPG/WEBP/GIF up to 10MB each."
- ✅ Fixed local reordering to use 1-based `sort_order` (matches backend)
- ✅ Existing features verified:
  - Upload button with loading state
  - Thumbnail grid display
  - Set primary button
  - Delete button with confirmation
  - Reorder arrows (left/right)
  - Disabled states during operations

#### Property Detail Gallery Enhancement (2.4)

Created `ImageLightbox.tsx` component:

- ✅ Full-screen image viewer
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Escape to close, Left/Right arrows)
- ✅ Click navigation (prev/next buttons)
- ✅ Image counter (e.g., "3 / 8")
- ✅ Caption display (if present)
- ✅ Dark overlay with centered content

Updated `PropertyDetailPage.tsx`:

- ✅ Integrated lightbox component
- ✅ Clickable image grid (primary + up to 4 thumbnails)
- ✅ Opens lightbox with correct image index
- ✅ Hover effects on grid images

### 3. Reviews System Verification

#### Backend Review Flow (Already Complete)

Verified existing implementation:

- ✅ `ReviewController::store()` creates pending reviews
- ✅ `PropertyController::show()` filters to approved reviews only
- ✅ `ReviewResource` in Filament for admin moderation
- ✅ Approve/Reject actions available
- ✅ Bulk actions supported

#### Frontend Review UI (Already Complete)

Verified existing implementation in `PropertyDetailPage.tsx`:

- ✅ Review submission form (rating + comment)
- ✅ Success message: "Review submitted and awaiting moderation."
- ✅ Form reset after submission
- ✅ Reviews display section with:
  - User name and date
  - Star rating
  - Comment text
  - Average rating calculation
- ✅ Only shows approved reviews to public

### 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Smoke Tests Documentation

Created `backend/deployment/SMOKE_TESTS.md`:

- ✅ Test Suite 1: Property Images Workflow
  - Owner uploads images (validation, processing, storage)
  - Owner manages images (set primary, reorder, delete)
  - Guest views property gallery (grid, lightbox, navigation)

- ✅ Test Suite 2: Review Submission & Approval
  - Guest submits review (creates pending)
  - Admin approves review (Filament UI)
  - Guest sees approved review (public display)

- ✅ Test Suite 3: Owner Portal Integration
  - Owner views own properties (filter)
  - Owner edits property with images (round-trip)

- ✅ Test Suite 4: Error Handling
  - Image upload limits (20 max)
  - Invalid file types
  - Oversized files (>10MB)
  - Unauthorized review approval

- ✅ Test Suite 5: Performance & Data Integrity
  - Image processing (resize, orient)
  - Concurrent uploads

- ✅ Regression checks and success criteria

### 5. Production Configuration

#### Environment Configuration

Updated `backend/.env.example`:

- ✅ Added `FILESYSTEM_DISK=public` with S3 production notes
- ✅ Documented SMTP mail configuration for production
- ✅ Included AWS S3 example configuration

Updated `frontend/.env.example`:

- ✅ Changed default `VITE_API_URL` from port 5000 → 8000
- ✅ Added production URL example

#### Production Deployment Guide

Created `backend/deployment/PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md`:

- ✅ Part 1: Server Setup (PHP, Composer, Node, Nginx, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis, SSL)
- ✅ Part 2: Backend Deployment (Laravel installation, .env config, migrations, symlinks)
- ✅ Part 3: Frontend Deployment (React build, Nginx config, SSL with Certbot)
- ✅ Part 4: Security Hardening (permissions, firewall, Fail2Ban)
- ✅ Part 5: Monitoring & Maintenance (log rotation, backups, health checks)
- ✅ Part 6: Deployment Workflow (checklist, deployment script)
- ✅ Part 7: Troubleshooting (common issues, solutions)
- ✅ Production checklist (all critical items)

### 6. Documentation Updates
