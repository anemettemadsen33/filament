  - **For Owners:** Total properties, published properties, total bookings, total revenue
  - **For Guests:** Total bookings, active bookings, total spent

### 5. Unified Bookings View (`MyBookingsPage.tsx`)
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/MyBookingsPage.tsx`

**Smart Filtering:**
- **For Owners:** Shows booking requests for their properties (where property.owner_id === user.id)
- **For Guests:** Shows their own bookings

**Booking Cards Display:**
- Property title and location
- Guest/Owner name (context-dependent)
- Check-in and check-out dates
- Number of guests

### 6. Backend API Updates

#### PropertyController (`backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/PropertyController.php`)

**Enhanced index() method:**
```php
if ($request->has('my_properties') && $request->user()) {
    $query->where('owner_id', $request->user()->id);
} else {
    $query->where('status', 'published');
}
```
- Supports `my_properties` query parameter
- Shows all statuses for owner, only published for public
- Maintains existing filters (city, country, type, price, guests)

**Existing CRUD methods verified:**
- âœ… `store()` - Creates properties with authorization check
- âœ… `update()` - Updates properties with authorization check
- âœ… `destroy()` - Deletes properties with authorization check

**Authorization:**
- Uses Laravel policies for access control
- Only property owner can update/delete their properties

#### API Routes (`backend/routes/api.php`)
All routes properly configured:
- `GET /api/properties` - List properties (public + owner filter)
- `GET /api/properties/{id}` - Get single property
- `POST /api/properties` - Create property (auth required)
- `PUT /api/properties/{id}` - Update property (auth required)
- `DELETE /api/properties/{id}` - Delete property (auth required)

### 7. Frontend Service Updates

#### Property Service (`frontend/src/services/property.service.ts`)
**Enhanced getAll() method:**
```typescript
async getAll(filters?: {
  // ... existing filters ...
  my_properties?: boolean  // NEW
}): Promise<{ data: Property[] }>
```

**All methods available:**
- âœ… `getAll(filters)` - List with optional filters
- âœ… `getById(id)` - Fetch single property
- âœ… `create(data)` - Create new property
- âœ… `update(id, data)` - Update existing property
- âœ… `delete(id)` - Delete property

### 8. Routing Configuration

#### App.tsx Routes
```tsx
/dashboard - Smart dashboard (role-based)
/dashboard/bookings - Unified bookings view (role-based)
/dashboard/properties - Owner property list
/dashboard/properties/new - Create property form
/dashboard/properties/:id/edit - Edit property form (NEW)
```
